02/14/2023 - It was a bad day.

I woke up late to the lab. I dropped my box of cereal while something fell on
me. I then went to the lab and knocked over the TA's laptop. It was raining all
day, I wonder if this is the theme for the week.

02-07-2023 - It was a good day.

Woke up early. Had a nice breakfast. Classes weren't boring - not even 3081 for
some reason. Not looking forward to the 5451 midterm on Thursday, though. I 
might go skiing on Friday, who knows?

01.28.2023 - Minnehack Day!

We've been planning this for months on end with disaster after disaster being
dealt with. The day itself has been magnificent - things (mostly) worked OOTB
and our planning paid off. It's not Dashcon 2! That's all I was hoping for and
we exceeded expectations!
